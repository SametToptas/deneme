# OSGEO PROJECT - MARKETS INFORMATION
## Project Scenario
As in the past, people need markets and buffets for the supply of food and similar products in order to survive today. The aim of the project is to provide access to the location information of the market or buffet they want to reach, together with the name, type and photo. Based on this situation, the coordinates of the markets and buffets to be used in the project were transferred to the database by both marking and photographing via QField, and then displayed in QGIS.

## Acquired Knowledge
After reviewing the implementation steps, you will be able to understand the process of developing a mobile geospatial data collection platform using technologies such as QField, QGIS, Postgres/PostGIS, and Syncthing, and build your own website on heroku, which is open source.

## Setting Up the Environment
This section describes the required steps to set up the development environment. In order to realise the steps described in subsequent sections in a smooth manner, it is recommended that the users:
- Open a Heroku account 
- Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS on their local computer
- Connect the Heroku database from QGIS
- Set up the project in QGIS
- Transfer the project from desktop PC (QGIS) to mobile data collection platform (QField).
